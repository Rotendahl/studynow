# Study Now Course : Data Analysis in Python

This repo has links and files for the video course at [Studynow](https://ida.studynow.dk/users/sign_in).

## Video List:

### Video 0: Welcome to the course

Introduction to the course

### Video 1: Tools of the trade

This video covers the tools that we use in the course.

- [Google Colab][gc]: An online fully fledged python environemnt.
- [Pandas][pan]: Python package that makes it easy to handle data
- [Plotly][plt]: Interactive plotting package that creates awesome graphs

### Video 2: Understanding Data Formats

This video covers what a data format is, and how a computer structures the
data on disk.

### Video 3: Working with data

In this video we import some data into pandas and covers the basic data frame
function. You can open the [notebook in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BM7ckrw_j3kFHJmUW8o8S9JVwAVhhMTY?usp=sharing)

### Video 4: Pandas Functions

Covers more advanced pandas functions such as filtering. If you want more
background check out the [10 minutes to pandas][min] guide.
You can also have a look at the [notebook in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BM7ckrw_j3kFHJmUW8o8S9JVwAVhhMTY?usp=sharing)

### Video 5: Simple Graphs

We look at how to conduct a small data driven experiment and how to plot it.
If you want to try different plots look at the pandas [documentation][graf].
You can also use the finished [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rE0C2aOIKWlwH0d0KBbCJQOwztt18CZG?usp=sharing)

### Video 6: Advanced graphs

This shows how to create interactive graphs using [plotly][plt].
Have a look at their examples or look at the finished [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sHxPTctyI0W1I604YqSTdFFDIRcn6WOV?usp=sharing)

### Video 7: Exporting data

We look at how we can augment the data with extra columns and how the data
can be exported to various formats.
Look at the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F5T8dTzUuHfqQJqP7O4G3t0_htR5p5fL?usp=sharing)

### Video 8: Machine Learning Case del

We build a simple model from scratch that can recognize handwritten digits,
using the nearest neighbor algorithm.
